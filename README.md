# iEMB 2.0
## A new iEMB for students at Hwa Chong

Hwa Chong has a history of having underpowered, low-quality portals for their students. This project aims to change that.

This project will be a new version of the Intergrated e-Message Board, which helps propogate data within the school.

It will feature changes which include
* A better interface
* Improved productivity

This project will **not** propogate to teachers' boards.
